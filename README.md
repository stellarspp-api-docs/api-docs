## API Vision

The future StellarApp API is designed to:

- let employers integrate StellarApp data into their ATS or HR systems  
- let partners create dashboards and analytics over **reputation and performance**  
- enable employees to reuse their professional profile in different tools  

Planned resource families (draft):

- `/employees`  professional profiles, skills, reviews  
- `/employers`  companies, branches, job offers  
- `/reviews` ratings from customers and employers  
- `/jobs`  job offers, applications and status  
- `/recognitions`  employee-of-the-month / employee-of-the-year events
